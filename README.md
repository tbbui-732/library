# Library Project

## Overview
The Library project is a frontend project aimed at enhancing my skills in JavaScript, using the FormData API to fetch user-inputted data, 
and developing JS classes. 

I also learned more about DOM manipulation and using HTML/CSS/JS to develop a dynamic modal window to improve the user experience.
